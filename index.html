        <h1>About "Reconstruction."</h1>
        <p>The project "Reconstruction." was created to help people. "Reconstruction." helps people to change, to be unstoppable and tells 
            about value of time. Our planet was faced with many global problems, 
            for example, teenagers smoking, some people don't have education...
            I want to help people, especially teenagers to be in a right passage. I tell a lot about I wrote in a book. You can read more
            by my book named "Reconstruction.".

        <h1>Be Unstoppable</h1>
        <p> If you want to be unstoppable you must know three "rules". At first, you must have your own mindset. You must learn, that people are different. 
            People are different not only in appearance, but also by mindsets. At second, you shouldn't care what everyone else thinks. They have their own
            opinion, you too, So, why you must explain something to someone? And at third, don't be afraid of someone. If you lose something, you learn something.
